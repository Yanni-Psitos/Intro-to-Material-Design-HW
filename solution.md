## Intro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) website design.

1. I like the elegant simplicity that the website achieves with its layout and scheme.

2. I like that the navigation is easy to use, as it should be, with thoughful design being very obviously prevalent.

3. I like the way the toolbar blends in seamlessly from the header and follows the scroll behavior, making clear use of the material design concept.

4. I like that material design brings together technology, science, and design, while incorporating a pop-professional look that is so unique to Android.

5. I enjoy the breath of fresh air the elevation and layouts appear. The subtle shadowing and transitions make all the difference, which is proven within the website itself, as well as its examples.
